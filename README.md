## Applied Project in Computer Vision - Traffic Lane Lines Detection

### Overview

This is the first project in the Computer Vision section of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Course. In this project, I leverage several computer vision techniques to detect the traffic lane lines given input images. The specific tasks are:

* Build a pipeline in Python to detect lane lines in images.
* Leverage the pipeline to detect lane lines in videos.

The techniques used in this project include Canny Edge Detector, Hough Transformation and Weighted Regression etc.

The details of the project can be found at the Project Report and Python Code below
